ABOUT SCOTT
The person behind the pitch.
After graduating with a Sports degree and an incurable wanderlust, Scott Gilbert quickly discovered an innate skill for building lasting professional relationships. That talent — combined with tenacity and a hunger to learn — led to a career climbing from order-entry roles to external sales leadership, where his entrepreneurial instincts could flourish.
Now, with 20+ years of IT sales experience behind him, Scott operates on the other side of the fence — headhunting the brightest technologists and placing them with top Trading Firms, Blockchain projects, and CyberSec organisations globally.
Outside of work, Scott is a dad, a husband, an adventurer, and an unashamed sports tragic. Whether he's exploring in a VW Camper Van, backpacking off the beaten track, or heading somewhere posh with a suitcase — he brings that same curiosity and energy to everything he does.

Relationships first. Every placement and partnership is built on genuine trust, not just transactions.

Personal service. You deal with Scott directly — no handoffs, no junior consultants, no lost context.

Real expertise. Two decades in IT sales means SDG speaks your language and understands your market.

WHY CHOOSE SDG
Big agency reach. Boutique attention.
The difference isn't just what SDG delivers — it's how. Here's what you can expect when you work with us.
01
You deal with Scott. Always.
No account managers, no juniors, no handoffs. When you work with SDG, you speak directly with the person who's done this for 20+ years and knows your industry inside out.
02
Relationships, not just databases.
SDG's network has been built over two decades of genuine connection-making. That means faster introductions, warmer candidates, and better outcomes than a cold database search ever delivers.
03
Niche expertise that counts.
IT, FinTech, CyberSec — these aren't sectors SDG dabbles in. They're the areas Scott has spent his entire career in, which means we understand the nuances, the players, and the market.
04
Three services. Zero runaround.
Whether you need top-tier talent, fresh leads, or funding you didn't know existed — SDG handles all three under one roof with the same level of care and commitment.
